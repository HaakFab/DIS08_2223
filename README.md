# Personal assignment 
- due on 15th December 22 
- (25% of points)

In this assignment, you will prove your knowledge on open data, data formats, and working with data in python by implementing your first data analysis project.
This project will include 
1. the **selection of your dataset**
2. **conceptualisation of your application** - define 
	- a task you want to perform,
	- a problem you want to solve, or 
	- a question which needs to be answered
3. **importing** your data in python
4. **cleaning** your data
5. **analysing** the data to fulfil the needs of your concept from 2.

You have to document everything, especially your 

## Evaluation criteria and Rating Matrix
We evaluate your projects based on two attributes:
1. **10 points: quality of your concept**:
	-  Is the chosen dataset interesting?
	-  How well does your chosen task fit the chosen dataset?
	-  Is the task formulated well?
	-  Is your task clever, did you "think outside the box"?
	-  How challenging is the chosen task, did you "make it easy" for yourself?
	-  How well did you use markdown to structure and  document your Concept?
and
2. **15 points: quality of your implementation**:
	-  Was the dataset imported correctly?
	-  Did you make sure, that the dataset was properly cleaned?
	-  Was your task successfully implemented?
	-  How much effort and work did you put into your project?

You do not necessarily lose points, if your results are not exciting, if your concept and implementation are done well. However, **we will punish any forms or attempts of cheating severely** (for example, copying from each other, copying parts of work or concepts from other publications without giving references). Also: Remember, that detailed documentation of your concept and the use of markdown are essential for your rating in the *Concept* category.

Your final points will be calculated as
$$score=concept*10+implementation*15$$
where $concept$ and $implementation$ are percentages based on the criteria mentioned above.
